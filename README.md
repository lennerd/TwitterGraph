TwitterGraph
============

## Idea

TwitterGraph is a Twitter data visualiziation built with Processing. It simple approach is to visualize geolocalized
data from the TwitterAPI. The result is a imaginary map with points, cirlces and lines.

## Future plans

There is no real documentation or "How to use it?" guide yet. I plan to build a Github page for it and decouple some components I find to be useful when working with the TwitterAPI and Processing.
